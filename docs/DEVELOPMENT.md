## Code style
As the whole project is done in javascript we will have a strictly policy about how javascript code will be written.
Using [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) with the set of rules provided by [airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) we assure ourselves from common mistakes and let us keep a good coding style.

[Editor config](http://editorconfig.org/) will also provide some rules about coding style for most editors.

## Documentation
The documentation will be generated by [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) in-file markup.
